# what-the-h3index

This is a tool to visualize the [H3 index](https://h3geo.org/) on each zoom level on a map.

Shoutout to [Benjamin Tran Dinh](https://github.com/benjamintd) and his tool [What the tile](https://github.com/benjamintd/what-the-tile) of which this project is pretty much an exact clone!
